                            <p>Fashion and style can be very impactful in daily life as people often relate their appearance, including outfitting and style, to their identity. However, selecting outfits is often a time-consuming and frustrating process. We set out to optimize the outfit selection process by offering people their entire wardrobe and personalized recommendations readily available.

                            <h2>How can we simplify the wardrobe decision making process?</h2>
                            <p>We began research by surveying indivudals on their outfit selection process. We found that over 60% of participants spend 30 mins or more each day choosing what to wear. Even more, 78% user stated they would use a personal stylist for their expertise in fashion. This insight provided grounding to our hypothesis of time and appearance being significant factors in the outfit selection process.</p>
                            <p>Next we interviewed 9 participants about their wardrobe influences and decision-making components. I wanted to understand how people approach selecting an outfit and any underlying motivations for wardrobe and how those choices impact what they decide to wear and how it makes them feel.</p>

                            <p>Key Insights:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mood: how a person feels in their outfit is directly linked to their confidence and self-image. Societal pressures can limit a person's style choice or impede of their decision to experiment with different styles.</li>
                                <li>Situation: Formal occasions such as work or events require more planning but greatly improve confidence when executed successfully.
                                Functionality is prioritized over appearance when planning for inclement weather and laborious activities like exercising and running errands. </li>
                                <li>Inspiration: External forces greatly influence style. We found that 55% of the participants used multiple social media apps for inspiration when curating an outfit. These pressures result in a desire to look good all the time. People also post pictures in outfit for social media engagement and increase # of views and potentially compliments received.</li>
